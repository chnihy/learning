# For loops

Follows the same format as JavaScript

```cpp
for (var-definition, condition, execution){
	//code block
}
```

var-definition creates your iterating variable once
condition deines the condition for executing the codeblock
execution happens every time the code block is executed 

ex:
var-definition: int i = 2;
condition: i <= 10;
execution: i++;
