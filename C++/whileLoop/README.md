# While Loops

While condition is met, code will be executed
``` cpp
while (condition){
	// code block
}
```

### Do/While
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_do_while_loop.asp">from W3 Schools</a>
<quote>The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</quote>

```cpp
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
